What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Git merge preserves the history of the 2 branches. Merge creates a new "merge commit" 
that handles the combining of the branches. 

Rebase rewrites the branches without preserving the history from both branches. 
Rebase creates new commits for each previous commit on the original branch. 

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version of a project that is hosted not on your local
computer. It can be accessed from multiple computers, not just the one that you
created the project on.
